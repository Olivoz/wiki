# wiki

This is a personal wiki documenting things for my school course TE4.

It currently contains:
- [intro](intro.md), which contains basic markdown formatting.
- [requirements](requirements.md), which contains some basic tool requirements for working in different languages.
- [git](git.md), which contains commands, faq and general info about working in Git.
